# Climate-linked-biogeography-of-fungal-spore-traits (DOI 10.5281/zenodo.15625677)

This repository contains codes for a global analysis of how climatic conditions shape biogeographic patterns of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal spore traits. By linking AM fungal spore trait data from the TraitAM database with species occurrence records and environmental variables, this project investigates traitâ€“environment relationships, phylogenetic conservatism, and functional diversity patterns across ecosystems.
